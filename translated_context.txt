- Obtain explicit consumer consent for personal information collection with separate checkbox
- Maximum single prize value: RMB 50,000

Special Provisions for Lottery-Type:
- Maximum prize cannot exceed RMB 50,000 (including cumulative theoretical maximum from multiple chances)
- Examples of exceeding limit: multiple winners over 50k each, cumulative draws over 50k, usage rights valued over 50k

Special Provisions for Gift-with-Purchase:
- Mark gift prices based on current selling price at same location or reference other channels
- For items without market price, mark as "not for sale, no market price"
