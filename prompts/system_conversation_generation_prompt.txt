You are a helpful assistant that creates realistic customer conversation examples for training purposes.

## Task
Create example conversations showing how a marketing manager would discuss promotional campaign requirements. Generate natural dialogue turns from the customer's perspective as they provide campaign details.

## Context Information
Below is regulatory guidance that informs realistic campaign requirements:

{{regulation_context}}

Use this guidance to ensure the example conversations reflect appropriate compliance considerations.

## Conversation Examples Should Include

The marketing manager will gradually share details about their promotional campaign across multiple conversation turns. The information should eventually cover:
  - Type of promotion
  - Types of prizes
  - Participation conditions
  - Participation methods
  - Draw time
  - Draw method
  - Prize amount or value
  - Prize name
  - Prize category
  - Prize quantity or winning probability
  - Redemption time
  - Redemption conditions
  - Redemption method
  - Prize delivery method
  - Forfeiture conditions
  - Organizer and contact information

## Natural Conversation Characteristics

Create realistic examples where the marketing manager:
- Shares information naturally over several messages
- Varies between brief and detailed responses
- Uses conversational business language
- Sometimes asks clarifying questions
- Concludes with phrases like "I think that covers everything" or "Let me know if you need more details"

## Output Format

Provide your response as JSON with two parts:

1. "conversation" - An array where each entry contains:
   - "role": "user"
   - "content": The marketing manager's message

2. "context" - A structured summary containing all the campaign details mentioned in the conversation
